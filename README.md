# The Cosmic (Alpha) Installer Script

With the help of this script, you will be able to install **Cosmic Alpha** in one of 3 methods as you can see in the image below. Keep in mind that the DE is still in its infancy, so play around with it on a test machine not a production one.

### Report Issues

To report any issues or request any features for the DE, please feel free to do so on the [**Pop_OS Github**](https://github.com/pop-os). Do not report any here, also I will not be responsible if you brick your system using it. Thanks.

Enjoy ;)
